            <h2>ABOUT</h2>

            <div id="coursedesc">
                <p> During these months of social distancing and lockdown, a lot of college students are not able to
                    attend
                    classes or go for internships where they could be learning practical tech skills. We, a team of
                    volunteers comprising professors, industry professionals, and students working in data science,
                    machine
                    learning, and deep learning have gotten together to offer a course to students of engineering
                    colleges
                    on these topics. There is no fee for this course, and this is our way of contributing to the Indian
                    and
                    world community in these trying times.</p>

                <p>We would like the course to be full of rewarding practical knowledge for the serious students, which
                    we
                    will achieve by giving rigorous programming exercises and mini-projects to apply the concepts
                    learned
                    during the course. We will attempt to make sure that all serious students who have the requisite
                    background knowledge are able to make progress on the course by getting their doubts cleared in
                    interactive video calls. Please see more details in the section about Topics and Pedagogy. The
                    course is
                    going to be rigorous, and we will be encouraging non-serious students to drop out at every step.</p>

            <h2>PEDAGOGY</h2>
            <div id="coursedesc">
                <p>The course will be divided in small modules, which will require one or two days of intense work each.
                    There will be approximately three modules covered each week for approximately eight weeks. The
                    following will be the <u>components of each module</u>:
                    <ul>

                            competition.</li>
                        <li>Assignment help session: A second online interactive video session will be conducted for
